To understand the difference between the different types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and metadata) and how this impacts underlying storage mechanisms.\r\n2. To understand the key differences between data management systems, such as relational database systems, key-value, document-oriented, big data driven alternatives (e.g., NoSQL), etc.\r\n3. Be able to select and implement the optimal data management system and associated workflow as a function of the data's volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and veracity.\r\n4. To understand basic cloud computing concepts, to include infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service, and managed service.\r\n5. To understand the fundamental organization and use of semi-structured data (e.g., XML, JSON)\r\n6. To construct and perform queries to select data for assembly into an analysis workflow for data science.\r\n7. To understand the need for and to use an available tool to carry out data cleaning and other data pre-processing activities in preparing data resources integrated from various sources.\r\n8. To understand common patterns of data flow through data science analysis workflows, such as big data processing patterns using a parallel processing paradigms such as map-reduce.\r\n\r\n## Grading Policy\r\nExams - 70%<br>\r\nHomework and Worksheets - 10%<br>\r\nFinal Exam - 20%\r\n\r\n## Grading Scale\r\nA: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the\r\ndiscretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\n### Grading Guidelines\r\nSubmitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and\r\nmaterials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy\r\n(http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html) and reference below).\r\n\r\nThe grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.<br>\r\nThe grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and mediumlevel\r\nachievement in the other.<br>\r\nThe grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and mediumlevel\r\nachievement in the others.<br>\r\nThe grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\n\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L. Whalley, Minjie Hu, and Phil Robbins. 2008.\r\nBloom's taxonomy for CS assessment. In Proceedings of the tenth conference on Australasian computing education\r\n- Volume 78 (ACE '08), Simon Hamilton and Margaret Hamilton (Eds.), Vol. 78. Australian Computer Society,\r\nInc., Darlinghurst, Australia, Australia, 155-161.\r\n\r\n### Exam Policy\r\nStudent performance will be accessed through weekly exams. Each exam will cover the material from the previous week. They will last no more than 15 minutes. No makeup exams will be allowed. Your lowest exam grade will be dropped.\r\n\r\n### Worksheet and Homework Policy\r\nWorksheets/homework will be assigned each week and collected each Thursday before the weekly exam. Homework will be graded pass or fail and are designed to help you study for the exams. For the majority of the classes, the worksheets will double as assigned homework for you to turn in before the following exam.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).<br>\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present\r\nsomeone else's work or ideas as your own.<br>\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if\r\nany, and explain their contribution to your work.<br>\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and\r\nStudent Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\n\r\n### Classroom Policies\r\n* Tuesday will be devoted to introducing new material. It has been shown in numerous studies that even having a laptop open during this type of instruction negatively affects not only your learning but those around you. Because of this, we will have a strict no\r\nlaptop policy open on the desk on Tuesday. I will do my best to record all lectures and post them in a timely fashion.<br>\r\n* You are expected to take good notes during class.\r\n* You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\n* You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you\r\nmiss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office\r\n(http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/general_info/absence/) ; also, you are responsible for announcements made in\r\nclass, assignment due dates, etc.\r\n* In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your\r\nclassmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook (http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/honorsystem/\r\nstudenthandbook/index.php) , section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\n\r\n### Late Policy\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. This course is an upper level course, and it will move very fast.\r\nFalling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n### Final Exam\r\nThe final exam will be comprehensive.\r\n \r\nSection 1 - April 26 from 4 - 7 PM\r\n\r\nSection 2 - April 28 from 12 - 3 PM\r\n\r\n## Facebook Group\r\nEveryone must join the Facebook group for class discussions: \r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/466621090194047/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/466621090194047/</a>\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\nYou are responsible for coming prepared to class. This includes reading through the material before attending class.\r\nYou will get a lot more out of the lectures and discussions in this manner. It is cliche, but true. Each week will follow a similar pattern. On Tuesday new material will be introduced and discussed. Thursday will start with an exam over the previous week's material. Followed by an interactive exercise. This will sometimes be guided. sometimes in groups, and sometimes individually. The schedule below is tentative and subject to change. You must check it regularly. \r\n\r\n## Week 1\r\n### Tuesday\r\nNo class\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Introduction to course and syllabus\r\n* Introduction to Data Science (if time)\r\n\r\n## Week 2\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Introduction to Data Science at Command Line (Command Line Chapter 1 abbreviated from here on as CL 1)\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/pub/w100pea/datascienceintrocommandline\">Prepared Notes</a>\r\n* Getting Started (CL 2)\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/pub/w100pea/commandlineenvironment\">Prepared Notes</a>\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over syllabus\r\n* Getting Started yourself (bring laptops) and worksheet\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5gwg82gt6qwcrw/01%20Worksheet%20and%20Homework.docx?dl=0\">Worksheet and Homework</a>\r\n\r\n## Week 3\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Obtaining Data (CL 3)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CL 1 and CL 2\r\n* Worksheet and lab on obtaining data\r\n\r\n## Week 4\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Creating Reusable Command-Line Tools (CL 4)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CL 3\r\n* Worksheet and lab on creating reusuable CL tools\r\n\r\n## Week 5\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Scrubbing Data (CL 5)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CL 4\r\n* Worksheet and lab on scrubbing data\r\n\r\n## Week 6\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Managing your data workflow (CL 6)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CL 5\r\n* Worksheet and lab on managing data workflow\r\n\r\n## Week 7\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Exploring Data (CL 7)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CL 6\r\n* Lab and Worksheet on Exploring Data\r\n\r\n## Week 8\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Parallel Pipelines (CL 8)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over Exploring Data (CL 7)\r\n* Lab and Worksheet on Parallel Pipelines\r\n\r\n## Week 9\r\n### Tuesday\r\nWe will now transition over to Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, which will be abbreviated SD.\r\n* Introduction and Overview (SD 1)\r\n* PostgreSQL (if time)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over parallel pipelines\r\n* PostgresSQL (SD 2)\r\n\r\n## Week 10\r\nSpring break\r\n\r\n## Week 11\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* PostgresSQL (SD 2)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Worksheet and Lab on PostgresSQL\r\n\r\n## Week 12\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Riak (SD 3)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over PostgresSQL (SD 2)\r\n* Worksheet and lab on Riak (SD 3)\r\n\r\n## Week 13\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* HBase (SD 4)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam on Riak (SD 3)\r\n* Worksheet and lab on HBase\r\n\r\n## Week 14\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* MongoDB (SD 5)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over HBase (SD 4)\r\n* Worksheet on MongoDB\r\n\r\n## Week 15\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* CouchDB (SD 6)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over MongoDB\r\n* Worksheet and lab on CouchDB\r\n\r\n## Week 16\r\n### Tuesday\r\n* Neo4J (SD 7)\r\n\r\n### Thursday\r\n* Exam over CouchDB (SD 6)\r\n* Worksheet and lab on Neo4J","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
